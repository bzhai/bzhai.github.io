<span style="color:#B22222">I am looking for students interested in doing a Ph.D. with me at the [Computer and Information Sciences](https://www.cis.Northumbria.ac.uk/), [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/) (UK). The research topics should focus on disentanglement representation learning in biomedical data. Please get in touch if you are interested.

<br/>
<br/>
Since September 2022, I am a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at the [Computer and Information Sciences](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/computer-and-information-sciences//), [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/) (UK). Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher working on the [IDEA-FAST](https://idea-fast.eu) project (€40 million) to identify digital endpoints and biomarkers of sleep disturbance and fatigue in the [OpenLab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/) at the [School of Computing](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/), [University of Newcastle upon Tyne](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/). I also had a chance to be a visiting scientist at the [MRC Epidemiology Unit](https://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), working with [Dr Søren Brage](https://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/people/soren-brage/) on the project of wrist-worn accelerometer-based human activity recognition.
<br/>
<br/>
I received my PhD degree from the [School of Computing](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing), [University of Newcastle upon Tyne](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/), working with [Dr Yu Guan](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/yu_guan/) in 2023. My research focuses on automated sleep stage monitoring using ubiquitous computing technologies.

<br/>
<br/>
I investigate topics in the fields of machine learning/deep learning and signal processing. I am particularly interested in sleep analysis, biosignal analysis, and healthcare applications.
