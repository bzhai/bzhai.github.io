_“Without redoubled diligence, there is neither talent nor genius”_ - Mendeleev

The following topics are the focus of my current research activities:

* **Deep learning/machine learning**<br/>*Representation learning and algorithms for time series signal analysis (e.g. IMU data, ECG, EEG, etc.)*

* **Machine hearing**<br/>*Multimodal data fusion for computational behavior analysis*

* **Brain monitoring**<br/>*Automatic sleep staging using wearable sensors, mobile EEG*

* **Digital biomarkers for fatigue and sleepiness monitoring**

* **Digital biomarkers for mental health monitoring based on voice/speech/language analysis**
<br/>

<!--- 
* Building biomarkers for sleepiness and fatigue in healthy and neurodegenerative disease populations.
* Deep learning/machine learning for time series data analysis
* Automatic sleep stage monitoring
* Voice analysis for mental health monitoring
* Building biomarkers for fatigue and sleepiness. For instance: Parkinson’s disease, and Sjögren's (pronounced show-grins) syndrome
* mHealth
